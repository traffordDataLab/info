        Altrincham is a sub-regional shopping centre, and Trafford's largest town. It's at the hub of south Manchester's modern transport infrastructure, complemented by an integrated rail, Metrolink and bus Interchange, which is undergoing redevelopment. It also acts as the commercial centre for the area providing extensive office accommodation. It has an historic market quarter, which regeneration works continue to modernise and upgrade.
